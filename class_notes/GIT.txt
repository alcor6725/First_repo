Version control system (VCS)
- System that records changes to a file or a group of files over a period of time so that we can recall a specific version later.
- Manges the changes to the code
- keeps track of each and every modification
- if any mistake is made, the users can compare and earlier versions and revert to a particular version of the code

Types of VCS:
1. Centralised VCS (CVCS)
2. Distributed VCS (DVCS)

GIT:
- DVCS
- Open source

How GIT works?

There are 3 stages of GIT.
3 stages of GIT:
1. Modified: means that the file is changed, but the version is not created
2. Committed: the changes that we made is safely and successfully saved/stored in the repo as a version
3. Staged: means that we have marked the changed files to create the version    
    
Basic GIT workflow:
- Modify the files in the working tree/dir
- Select the files to stage which are needed to be part of the next commit. Add only those changes to the staging area.
- Perform commit - This takes the files from the staging area and stores that snapshop permanently to the local GIT repo.
- Push the commit to remote repo (GitHub).

2 ways of obtaining a GIT repo in local machine
1. Creating a new empty GIT repo
2. Clone an existing repo (from GITHUB)
